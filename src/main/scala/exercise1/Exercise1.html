<h1>Exercise 1</h1>

<p>The objective of exercise 1 is to understand how to connect Chisel components with Decoupled interfaces,
and adapt to modules which have "demanding" interfaces and flow control patterns.</p>

<p>The Multipler component used in this design has two input interfaces which are both demanding, and
which have different demands for incoming data.  To compute the square, both inputs of the multiplier
should receive the same input value, however connecting all the interfaces together as shown in the
lecture notes results in a construct which itself is demanding, and therefore cannot be connected to
another demanding interface.</p>

<p>Therefore the goal is to create a design which connects to the exercise1 <b>dataIn</b> port which provides
data to the two Mult input ports in a permissive way.  An example of what the input and output signals
should look like after your changes is shown below.</p>

<script type="WaveDrom">
{ signal: [

  { name: "clk",        wave: 'p...|..'},
  { name: "in.valid",   wave: '010.|..'},
  { name: "in.data",    wave: 'x4x.|..', data:['A']},
  { name: "in.ready",   wave: '1.0.|.1'},
  {},
  { name : "out.valid", wave: '0...|10'},
  { name : "out.ready", wave: '1...|.0'},
  { name : "out.data",  wave: 'x...|4x', data:['A*A']},
  {},

],
  config: {
  hscale : 2
  }

  }
</script>

<p>The changes made to Exercise1 should be within the Exercise1Replicate block.  This block
needs to replicate the incoming data across the two Multiplier input ports, and take into
account that those ports may both be demanding and require separate valid/ready control
signals.</p>
