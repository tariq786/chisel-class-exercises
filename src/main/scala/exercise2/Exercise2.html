<h1>Exercise 2</h1>

<p>The objective of exercise 2 is to create your first library component.  This block is called Decoupled,
and it accepts data from a single input interface and replicates the data across multiple output interfaces,
using the input port *dest* to control which interfaces receive the replicated data.</p>

<p>The waveform below shows three sample transactions for a two-output distributor implementation.
    <script type="WaveDrom">
{ signal: [

  { name: "in.valid",   wave: '0101..01.0'},
  { name: "in.ready",   wave: '1.0..10.10'},
  { name: "in.bits",    wave: 'x4x4..x4.x', data:['foo', 'bar', 'yug']},
  { name: "in.dest",    wave: 'x4x4..x4.x', data:['11', '01', '10']},
  {},
  { name : "out(0).valid", wave: '0.10..10..'},
  { name : "out(0).ready", wave: '0.101.....'},
  { name : "out(0).bits",  wave: 'x.5x..5x..', data:['foo', 'bar']},
  {},
  { name : "out(1).valid", wave: '0.1..0..10'},
  { name : "out(1).ready", wave: '0...101..0'},
  { name : "out(1).bits",  wave: 'x.5..x..5x', data:['foo', 'yug']},
  {},

],
  config: {
  hscale : 1
  }

  }
</script>

The first transaction is sent to both output ports, each of which complete the request at different times.
Your distributor implementation should be permissive, so should not require that output ports assert
ready at the same time.</p>

<p>The second and third transactions are sent only to one of the two output ports, demonstrating how the
dest control port selectively replicates data.  The non-selected interface ports do not receive valid
signals, and therefore should ignore their *bits* input ports.</p>

<h2>Optional Exercises</h2>

<p>These optional exercises provide additional implentations of a Distributor with identical
interfaces but different performance characteristics.  Implementing these are optional, and
they are not used in the final project, but will enhance your understanding of Chisel and
component library design.</p>

<h3>Combinatorial Distributor</h3>

<p>The combinatorial distributor trades off having <i>demanding</i> interfaces instead of helpful
for a zero-cycle latency.  This is useful for certain latency-critical applications, or those
where custom buffering is needed, and therefore the user does not desire having an additional
buffer and latency built into the distributor.</p>

<p>The waveform below shows the timing changes for the combo implementation.  Note in
particular the change in the in.ready signal, which is now low by default (as it has a
dependency on the out.ready signals).</p>

<script type="WaveDrom">
{ signal: [

  { name: "in.valid",   wave: '01..01010'},
  { name: "in.ready",   wave: '0..101010'},
  { name: "in.bits",    wave: 'x4..x4x4x', data:['foo', 'bar', 'yug']},
  { name: "in.dest",    wave: 'x4..x4x4x', data:['11', '01', '10']},
  {},
  { name : "out(0).valid", wave: '010..10..'},
  { name : "out(0).ready", wave: '0101.....'},
  { name : "out(0).bits",  wave: 'x5x..5x..', data:['foo', 'bar']},
  {},
  { name : "out(1).valid", wave: '01..0..10'},
  { name : "out(1).ready", wave: '0..101..0'},
  { name : "out(1).bits",  wave: 'x5..x..5x', data:['foo', 'yug']},
  {},

],
  config: {
  hscale : 1
  }

  }
</script>

<h3>Fully-Buffered Distributor</h3>

<p>The fully buffered distributor has an output buffer for each destination,
rather than a single shared buffer for all destinations.  This allows it to
accept transactions for other destinations even when one of its outputs is
persistently flow controlled.</p>

<p>The full distributor is <i>helpful</i> on all of its output interfaces, but
must be <i>demanding</i> on its input interface, as it needs to know which
destinations have been requested before it can assert ready.</p>

  //{ name: "in_valid", wave: '010101010'},
  //{ name: "in_ready", wave: '1.0101010'},

  { name: "in_ready", wave: '01..0..10..1.'},
